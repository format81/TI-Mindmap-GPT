## Title: The Evolution of TI Mindmap: Community Edition + TI Mindmap Hub

## Body:

Hi everyone! 👋

First of all, **thank you** to all 100+ of you who starred this repository. Your support and feedback have been incredibly motivating and have shaped the direction of this project.

I wanted to share an update on where TI Mindmap is heading and get your thoughts.

### TI Mindmap GPT (This Repo) — Still Open Source, Still Active

This repository remains **open source under GPLv3** and continues to be maintained. It's the tool many of you know: bring your own API key, analyze reports manually, full control. It's great for individual analysts, experimentation, and anyone who wants to run their own threat intelligence analysis.

### TI Mindmap Hub — For Teams That Need Automation

Based on feedback from many of you, one theme kept coming up: **"I love the analysis, but I wish it ran automatically."**

That's exactly what **[TI Mindmap Hub](https://ti-mindmap-hub.com/landingpage)** does:

- Processes 50+ OSINT sources automatically, 24/7
- No API keys or infrastructure to manage
- STIX 2.1 export for your SIEM/SOAR/TIP
- IOC search engine across all processed reports
- Weekly AI-powered intelligence briefings

Think of it as the "managed service" version of what this repo does manually.

### What This Means for the Community Edition

- **This repo is NOT being deprecated** — it continues to serve its purpose
- Maintenance updates and bug fixes will continue
- New major features will be developed primarily for Hub
- Community contributions are still very welcome

### I'd Love Your Feedback

- What features matter most to you in the community edition?
- Would a free tier on Hub be interesting for individual analysts?
- Any other ideas for bridging the two experiences?

Drop a comment below — I read every one of them.

Thanks again for the support! 🙏

— Antonio
